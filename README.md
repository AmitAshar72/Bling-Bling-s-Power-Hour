# Bling-Bling-s-Power-Hour

‘Bling Bling’s power hour’ is a 2D side scroller puzzle developed in Unreal Engine 4, with a team of 8 members, which openly parody’s the battle royal trend and TV show mentality with dangerous risks. The game was inspired by the VR game, American Dream, a satire on the gun culture, wherein the player can use the gun for everything but to kill. The purpose of the BBPH is to find the exit whilst solving certain puzzles by interacting with the environment using the gun.
